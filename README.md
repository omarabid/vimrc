vimrc
=====

The following repository is created to follow the changes in my vimrc configuration.

P.S.: I use an AZERTY keyboard.

## Vim Setup

1- First, install Vim (if not already installed). This configuration file is made to work with Vim (not gVim or Vi).

2- Second, install vundle the package manager of choice using the following command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

3- Install the Exuberant Ctags module for the TagBar to work properly. Get the URL of the last package from `http://ctags.sourceforge.net/`

```
rpm -Uvh http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags-5.8-1.i386.rpm
```

4- Install the required Syntax checkers

```
npm install jslint -g
npm install csslint -g
pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
```

5- Install a PowerLine patached font; this will make some symbols look nicer

You can find the fonts here: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts

6- Finally, run the following command in Vim to install the vundle packages.

```
$ BundleInstall
```

7- You are ready to start coding!

### Features

It's good to talk about some of the features that this particular setup bring

1- Code Highlighting.

2- Syntax Checking for HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP.

3- A directory explorer.

4- Intelligent Status Bar.

5- AutoSave file.

6- Enhanced code indenting for HTML, PHP and JavaScript.

7- Substitution and search highlighting.


**Key Bindings**

1- Use `Space+j`, `Space+h`, `Space+k`, `Space+l` to move between split windows.

2- Use `B` to select the text inside a Tag, and `V` to select the whole tag.

3- Use `W` to select the current word, `X` to select the text inside parens and `C` to select text between quotes.

3- Use `jj` instead of Esc to switch to the command mode.

4- `F6` to run a Syntactic check, `F7` to display Syntactic errors list and `F8` to display the Tagbar

5- Use `r` to replace selected text with text in the clipboard.

6- Up, Left, Down and Right keys are disabled in command mode. Use `j`, `h`, `k`, and `l` instead.

7- Use `cc` to comment/uncomment a block of code. More commands are available through the NerdCommenter plugin.

8- Use `:S` to highlight substitution.

9- Use `Â²` when in insert mode to toggle paste mode.
